## Learning Haskell

I have started learning Haskell and this repository is for my practice and learning.
The main motivation to study Haskell was to supplement my University module - Programming Language Principles and Design

Some of the resources I use: 

- [Learn you a Haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/chapters.html)
- [Educative - Functional Programming Haskell](https://www.educative.io/courses/functional-programming-haskell)
- [Introductory Haskell course of the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html)

For add-on reading and tinkering: 

- [Real World Haskell by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)
- [Learn Haskell by building a blog generator](https://learn-haskell.blog/)
- [Find more on Haskell Documentatio](https://www.haskell.org/documentation/)
